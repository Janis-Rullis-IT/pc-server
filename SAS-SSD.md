SAS offers optional compatibility with Serial ATA (SATA), versions 2 and later. This allows the connection of SATA drives to most SAS backplanes or controllers. The reverse, connecting SAS drives to SATA backplanes, is not possible.

SAS controllers enable the use of SATA drives to expand the storage capacity with cost-effectiveness. 
The use of SATA hard drives on SAS controllers is made possible by the fact that both share the same infrastructure and have similar features.
 
* **SATA drives may be plugged into SAS controllers.**
* SAS drives cannot be plugged into SATA controllers.
