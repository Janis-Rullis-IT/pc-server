# Cloud

## Best options (in my opinion)

### Base

> This would be all that's needed for small projects. For bigger ones this help to share the load. 

Share the load with free services like Github and cdn.statically.io.

Use cheap clouds (like DigitalOcean, Kamatera, Vultr) where free ones doesn't fit. Just search for brst deals and read reviews. New better services appear every year.

### For mid

* Fixed count or on-demand-added instances controlled with open-source tools like Kubernettes and container orchestrates hosted in those cheap Clouds.

### For large 

* Google Cloud (cheaper and easier to manage than AWS).
