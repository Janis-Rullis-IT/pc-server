# How to play music stored on Type C flash?

First I tried **VLC**. When started it asks if I want to add this media to 
the media library. Selected 'Yes', nothing happens even after a refresh.
Went to the settings and checked the storage to be auto-scanned. Nothing.
When exit and start again. It asks the same question, if I want to add it to 
media-lib. Tried clearing cache. Same thing. Does not find the music from the 
storage.

* Go to `Tools/Settings/Media Library`/.
* Click on the plus icon `+ Music folders`.
* `Specify path manually...`.
* `Launch sys folder picker` will open `Google drive` like file explorer.
* Click on the `=` menu on the top left corner.
* Select your device.
* Click on the blue `Select` button.
* You will be returned back to the `Media Library` section.
* Click on the `RESCAN` button on the right top corner.
* Wait till it changes status to `idle`.
* Now you can browse your music.
