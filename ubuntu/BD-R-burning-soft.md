# BD-R-burning-soft

* Better write on Linux, because Windows has filename limitations like for example, it will throw a duplicate-file error if there is File.png and file.png.
* Some 100 GB discs can actually contain 96 GB or less. If You try to add 100 GB the burner will refuse to continue, some even won't explain why.

## Xburn

* Doesn't offer the 'Save As' option.

## K3B

* Shows detailed info about the burner (like can it write) and the disc.

### Pros

* Hanles filename issues only when the burning is started.
* Has the unsolved 'could not determine size' error.

## Brasero

* Handles filename issues right when they are added.
