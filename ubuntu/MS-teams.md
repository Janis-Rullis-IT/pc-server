## Empty interface

The interface may be empty and "You haven't got a team or a similiar message" may appear even if the registration may be completed.

### Solution

Logout didn't help. Restart helped. Maybe it was related with the time needed to wait.

## Device not available

If a new device was added then it might not appear in the Teams.

### Solution

Quit and Open again.

## Sound missing

A restart helped.

## Adjusting sound levels

* Use Your OS System Sound Settings.
* Avoid 'Device config or status whatever it is called' thingy when having a call, because after using it, the sound may
periodically fade-in and out. If that happens then better Quit, adjust via System Sound Settings and re-Open.

## Video zoomed in

Yes, that's a thing it does - zooms in a bit. So if You have adjusted video for other platforms like Zoom then be prepared that in MS Your ugly mug will be closer :D.
