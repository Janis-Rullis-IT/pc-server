# Welcome to the future!
No need to manually edit partitions and run LUKS commands.

* DO NOT choose the Manual Installation.
* Choose the 'Erase the disk and install ubu" AND click on the **`Advanced features / Use LVM with encryption`.**.
* Done.

Side hint:
Use the safe graphic option (or cli if available) when booting, if the installer "crashes".
