## I don't see that option in my ThinkPad's BIOS. Why not?
There are two reasons the Disk Encryption menu will not appear in the BIOS: 
1. **The drive in the system is not an FDE hard drive **
2. The menu option has not been enabled Since the BIOS menu is dynamic, the **Disk Encryption menu** will not be displayed if an FDE drive is not present. 
However, if your system does have an FDE drive, but the menu still does not appear, the menu option must be enabled using the following utility.

## If the key is on the drive, how do I prevent would-be thieves from stealing the data off my drive?
To completely protect your data, it is absolutely vital that a **hard drive password** be set. This can be a user password or both a user and master password.
The hard drive password prevents unauthorized users from booting the drive and accessing your data, while full disk encryption prevents 
more sophisticated attacks, such as attempting to retrieve data directly from the drive's platters.

## What is Full Disk Encryption (FDE)?
FDE is a method for encrypting hard drives in such a way that all data on the drive is always encrypted, without the use of third party encryption solutions. 

## How do I enable encryption?
There is no need to enable encryption. FDE drives always encrypt data on the disk. No initial set up is required. In fact, it is not possible to
disable encryption on an FDE hard drive.

## Can I move an encrypted drive to another ThinkPad and still access the data?
Yes. The encryption key is not system specific. Since the key is maintained by the drive, it is possible to move the drive to another system still access the data.
