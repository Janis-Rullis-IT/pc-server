# 0-Fix-Black-Boot-on-AMD.md
Seems that since 22.04 ubu the system goes blank after the installation reboot. Recovery mode is displayed fine.
Internet is filled with suggestions of either chaning grub default values or updating amd drivers, but none of those worked for me personally.
What worked was - **using a DisplayPort of the card instead of HDMI**.
