## Any computer that comes with Windows after 2012 has the key burned into the BIOS.

You have no need for a COA or a product key. Reinstall Windows 10, click "do this later" when it asks for a product key, and Windows will automatically activate when you connect to the Internet.

The only time you would need to worry about Microsoft is if you paid to change your edition of Windows. In that case, keep the email that contains your product key!

## The COA was removed because of extremely poor print quality

The COA was removed because Microsoft sold every single Windows Vista and 7 systems with COAs of extremely poor print quality which were prone to fading. The product keys on COAs were also pirated...

Since Windows 8 OEM was released the product keys have been embedded in the UEFI BIOS. Installation Media of the correct Edition will automatically input the product key taking the user to the license agreement screen: https://philipyip.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/win10oemcorrect.gif

The incorrect Edition will ask for a key: https://philipyip.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/win10oemwrong.gif
