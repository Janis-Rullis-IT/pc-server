# [Is OEM Windows locked to hard drive or motherboard?](http://www.tomshardware.co.uk/answers/id-3374485/oem-windows-locked-hard-drive-motherboard.html)

* OEM windows from Dell/HP/ect. is locked to the motherboard.
* OEM Windows you bought off Amazon or something is transferable.

* OEM= 1 time only
* Retail= delete and you can use it again.

so if you ever are going to swap out a motherboard( cuz the license will attach to the motherboard and not the hdd) retail, otherwise oem.
