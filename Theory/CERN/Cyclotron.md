# [Cyclotron](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclotron)

A cyclotron is a type of particle accelerator invented in 1929â€“1930.
A cyclotron accelerates charged particles outwards from the center of a flat cylindrical vacuum chamber along a spiral path.
The particles are held to a spiral trajectory by a static magnetic field and accelerated by a rapidly varying (radio frequency) electric field.
