# [Synchrotron](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchrotron)

A synchrotron is a particular type of cyclic particle accelerator, descended from the [cyclotron](Cyclotron.md), in which the accelerating particle beam travels around a fixed closed-loop path. The magnetic field which bends the particle beam into its closed path increases with time during the accelerating process, being synchronized to the increasing kinetic energy of the particles
