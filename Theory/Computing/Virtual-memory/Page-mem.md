# [Page-mem.md](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_(computer_memory))

Block of virtual memory, described by a single entry in the page table. 
It is the smallest unit of data for memory management in a virtual memory operating system.
Similarly, a page frame is the smallest block of physical memory into which memory pages are mapped.

A transfer of pages between main memory and an auxiliary store, such as a hard disk drive, is referred to as paging or swapping.
