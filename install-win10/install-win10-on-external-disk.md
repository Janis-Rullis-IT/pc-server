## Solution
[WinToUSB](https://www.easyuefi.com/wintousb/) does the work. You select the 
Windows ISO file and the external drive. 

**Beware!** Next step requires to select the Windows 10 edition like S, N, Home,
 PRO, etc. By default S is selected which is a limited version which only allows
to install software from MS store. 

The installation takes aprox. 10-20 minutes and after that the Windows is all set
up and only requires few startup configurations like user name and password.
